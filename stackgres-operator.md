Set the scene/backstory. What is the issue? What is going on? What is the current state of things without this [application]? Remember to use citations for any stats or datasets ([Citation, 2050](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/in_text_citations_the_basics.html)).

## What is the [StackGres](https://stackgres.io/)?

Give a summary and explain what this *application* is.

## What is the [StackGres](https://stackgres.io/) operator?

If you are writing about operators, give a short concise summary of what operators are and their use.

## What are the benefits and use cases for using the [StackGres](https://stackgres.io/) operator?

Why should they know about this? Why should readers use *application*? How will this benefit them?

## Installing [StackGres]([https://stackgres.io/](https://stackgres.io/install/)) on [OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift)

_Requirements: List requirements, disclaimers, notes, etc. Things that the readers should be aware of before installation. Below is a step by step of how to include gifs as an example of what the step by step tutorial should look like._

#### Step 1: Record & Edit your video
- Record your tutorial and save it locally on to your system

*Note: Add any useful code blocks you may have.*

Include a concluding paragraph after the instructions to sum everything up and wrap up this section.

## Conclusion

Sum up the entire article and emphasize the key takeways and one main point they should most definitely take away above all else.

Include a segway for them to do more research and find more information on similar topics and the next steps, etc.

## Additional Resources *(optional)*

- [include links to additional resources, videos, articles, code repos, etc.](https://hackmd.io/@mkong/r1htqisUh)

## Appendix *(optional)*

Include more extensive code sections here or if you have more comprehensive information that will be helpful but not entirely needed in the body of the article, include it here as well.
